The goal for the [2021 WIDS competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021) is to predict whether a patient admitted into the ICU has diabetes. The submission is evaluated using Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve between the predicted and the observed target (diabetes_mellitus_diagnosis).

This was my first-ever Kaggle competition and my team achieved 87th place in the final leaderboard, top 10% of all the teams. Not too bad for a first Kaggle competition! 

In our final competition submission, we incorporated some features generated by a previous Kaggle notebook, used light gradient boost machine (lightGBM) to train the model, bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, and implemented pseudo-labeling in hope to further increase the accuracy of the model.
